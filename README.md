## From the Creator

> "I created Thorium‑AI because I was tired of seeing people either fear AI or blindly trust it without understanding what it actually is. Most AI education is either too technical or too vague. There was nothing for regular people who just want to understand this technology that's changing everything."

This project represents hundreds of hours of independent work, focused on accessibility and real‑world relevance.
