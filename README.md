# Thorium-AI - Free AI Encyclopedia

A comprehensive, free encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence. From basic concepts to advanced neural networks, explained clearly.

## Project Overview

**Thorium-AI** is an educational project created by a single enthusiast. The goal is to make AI knowledge accessible to everyone, regardless of background.

### Key Features
- **Completely free** — no subscriptions, no payments, no hidden fees
- **50+ topics** and **250+ articles** covering AI from fundamentals to advanced concepts
- **Manually created content** — no AI-generated content, only verified information
- **Progressive learning** — each topic begins with beginner introductions and progresses to advanced concepts

## Content Structure

The encyclopedia is organized into 8 comprehensive sections:

1. **Practical AI** – Everyday applications and real-world use cases
2. **AI Fundamentals** – History, philosophy, and core principles
3. **Mathematics for AI** – Essential mathematical foundations
4. **Machine Learning** – Core algorithms and methodologies
5. **Neural Networks** – From biological inspiration to artificial implementations
6. **Deep Learning** – Advanced architectures and techniques
7. **Applied Directions** – NLP, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning
8. **Advanced Topics** – Ethics, limitations, and future developments

## Target Audience

- **For Beginners** – Start from scratch with simple explanations
- **For Developers** – Mathematics, algorithms, and implementation details
- **For Professionals** – Advanced topics and research analysis
- **For Everyone** – AI's impact on society and ethical considerations

## Project Philosophy

This project is built on the belief that AI knowledge should not be locked behind paywalls or available only to students of elite universities. Every article is written and created manually to ensure clarity and accuracy.

## From the Creator

"I'm the person behind Thorium-AI. I'm not associated with any university or corporation — just someone passionate about AI who believes knowledge should be free.

This project requires hundreds of hours of work. I do it because:
- I remember struggling to find clear explanations when learning AI
- AI literacy is crucial for everyone
- I want to give back to the community
- Education should not be a luxury product"

## Technical Implementation

The project uses modern web technologies:
- Clean, responsive HTML5 structure
- External CSS for styling
- JavaScript for interactive elements
- Font Awesome icons for visual cues
- Mobile-friendly design with touch gestures support

## Support

If you find this project valuable, you can support it through the **Support Project** option. This helps cover server costs and allows more time for content creation.

Most importantly — use this resource, share it, and let's make AI education accessible together.
