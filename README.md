**Thorium-AI** is a practical guide to Artificial Intelligence for everyday life. No code, no complex theories — just clear explanations of how AI already works around you. From TikTok algorithms to ChatGPT, from deepfakes to self-driving cars.

## About the Project

Thorium-AI offers a completely new approach to learning about artificial intelligence. We start with what you already experience every day: YouTube recommendations, TikTok algorithms, voice assistants, and autocorrect. Then we build up to ChatGPT, AI image generation, deepfakes, and beyond.

This is **AI education for real life** — not for programmers.
