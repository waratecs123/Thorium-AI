## What We're Building
**We're creating a comprehensive AI course from scratch.** This is original educational content, not a compilation of existing materials.

## Project Essence
- **Format:** In-depth, detailed lesson-articles in Russian
- **Goal:** Explain AI as simply as possible but without oversimplification
- **Audience:** Complete beginners → intermediate level
- **Style:** "Explain like I'm 15" - clear, with analogies and practical examples

## What We're NOT Doing
- Collecting/translating others' articles
- Surface-level content
- Technical documentation
- Marketing/promotional material

## Structure
The course follows a logical progression from basics to advanced topics, with each section building on previous knowledge. We're writing everything ourselves, maintaining consistent voice and quality throughout.
