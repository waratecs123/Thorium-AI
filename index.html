            <div class="project-description">
                <p><strong>Thorium-AI</strong> is an independent educational project created by a single enthusiast
                driven by the belief that artificial intelligence knowledge should be universally accessible.
                The project represents a personal commitment to breaking down the barriers that often make
                advanced technical education exclusive to those with institutional affiliations or financial means.</p>

                <div class="highlight">
                    <p>This project is completely <strong>free</strong> — no subscriptions, no payments,
                    no hidden fees, no premium tiers, and no data harvesting for commercial purposes.
                    All content is available to anyone with internet access, regardless of geographical location,
                    educational background, or financial status. The encyclopedia operates on a simple principle:
                    knowledge grows when shared, and AI literacy is too important to be commodified.</p>
                </div>

                <p>As one person, I invest significant time, effort, and personal resources into creating,
                maintaining, and expanding this encyclopedia because I fundamentally believe that AI knowledge
                should not be locked behind paywalls, academic journal subscriptions, or available only to
                students of elite universities. The rapid development of artificial intelligence affects
                everyone, and everyone should have the opportunity to understand it.</p>

                <p>Every article, diagram, and explanation is meticulously researched, written, and created
                manually. No AI-generated content — only carefully verified information explained with clarity
                and precision. Each topic undergoes multiple revisions to ensure accuracy, readability, and
                educational value. The content balances theoretical foundations with practical applications,
                providing readers with both understanding and utility.</p>

            <h2 class="project-title">From the Creator</h2>

            <div class="project-description">
                <p>I'm the person behind Thorium-AI. I'm not associated with any university, research institution,
                or corporation — just someone deeply passionate about artificial intelligence who fundamentally
                believes that knowledge, especially transformative knowledge like AI, should be freely available
                to all who seek it. This project represents a personal stand against the increasing commodification
                of education and technical knowledge.</p>

                <p>This project requires hundreds of hours of research, writing, editing, coding, and design work.
                I choose to invest this time because:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>I remember struggling to find clear, coherent explanations when first learning AI concepts,
                    bouncing between overly simplified articles and impenetrable academic papers. Thorium-AI aims
                    to fill that gap with content that respects both the complexity of the subject and the
                    intelligence of the reader.</li>

                    <li>AI literacy is becoming as crucial as basic computer literacy was two decades ago.
                    Understanding artificial intelligence is no longer just for specialists — it's necessary
                    for informed citizenship, career development, and meaningful participation in a
                    technology-driven world.</li>

                    <li>I want to give back to the global community that has shared so much knowledge freely
                    online. This project follows in the tradition of open-source software and collaborative
                    knowledge projects that have accelerated technological progress worldwide.</li>

                    <li>Education should not be a luxury product. The current trend toward subscription-based
                    learning platforms, expensive courses, and paywalled research creates artificial barriers
                    to knowledge that disproportionately affect those in developing regions or with limited
                    financial means.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>If you find this project valuable, you can support it through the
                <strong>Support Project</strong> button in the sidebar. Contributions directly help cover
                server costs, domain registration, development tools, and allow more dedicated time for
                content creation and improvement. Every contribution, regardless of size, is deeply
                appreciated and directly reinvested into making Thorium-AI more comprehensive, accessible,
                and valuable.</p>

                <p>Most importantly — use this resource, share it with others who might benefit, suggest
                improvements or topics you'd like to see covered, and let's work together to make
                comprehensive AI education truly accessible to everyone, everywhere. Knowledge grows through
                sharing, discussion, and collaboration. Thorium-AI is not just a static resource but an
                evolving project that improves through community engagement and feedback.</p>

                <p>Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the knowledge you're seeking here.
                Remember that understanding artificial intelligence is a journey, not a destination —
                there's always more to learn, and Thorium-AI aims to be a reliable companion on that
                lifelong learning journey.</p>
